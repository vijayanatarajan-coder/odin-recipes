<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Idli or idly is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Black gram</li>
    <li>fenugreek seeds</li>
</ul>
<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Soak the rice and urad dal in separate bowls for at least 4 hours. These will be later ground together to make a batter which ferments for 6 hours or more.</li>
    <li>Grind the soaked items separately. This is best done with a stone grinder, but a high powered blender can also do the job (although the batter will be somewhat more coarse in texture).[2]
        Grind the soaked rice.
        Grind the soaked urad dal.</li>
    <li>Mix the ground rice and urad dal together.</li>
    <li>Set aside in a warm place to ferment for 8 hours. Use a crock pot on the "keep warm" setting or an oven on the "proof" setting if you live in an area where the ambient temperature is below 75 °F (24 °C).</li>
    <li>Add salt.</li>
    <li>Oil the idli steamer plates.</li>
    <li>Spoon the batter into the plates.</li>
    <li>Set the idli steamer into a large, pre heated pot with water in the bottom for steaming.</li>
    <li>Steam the batter for 5-10 minutes or until fluffy.</li>
    <li>Remove the idlis from the steamer and serve warm with Chutney, or Sambhar.</li>
</ol>
