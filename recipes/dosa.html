<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Raw Rice: 2 cups (preferably a mix of parboiled and raw rice, but you can use only raw rice too)</li>
    <li>Urad Dal (Split Black Gram): 1/2 cup</li>
    <li>Fenugreek Seeds (Methi Seeds): 1/2 teaspoon</li>
    <li>Salt: To taste</li>
    <li>Water: As needed for grinding and fermenting</li>
    <li>Oil or ghee (for cooking)</li>

</ul>
<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Soak the rice and urad dal in separate bowls for at least 4 hours. These will be later ground together to make a batter which ferments for 6 hours or more.</li>
    <li>Grind the soaked items separately. This is best done with a stone grinder, but a high powered blender can also do the job (although the batter will be somewhat more coarse in texture).[2]
        Grind the soaked rice.
        Grind the soaked urad dal.</li>
    <li>Mix the ground rice and urad dal together.</li>
    <li>Set aside in a warm place to ferment for 8 hours. Use a crock pot on the "keep warm" setting or an oven on the "proof" setting if you live in an area where the ambient temperature is below 75 °F (24 °C).</li>
    <li>Add salt.</li>
    <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan. Using the back of the ladle, gently spread the batter in a circular motion, starting from the center, to form a thin, even circle.</li>
    <li>Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges and on top of the dosa.</li>
    <li>Cook the dosa on medium heat until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown.</li>
    <li>If you want a crispy dosa, you don’t need to flip it. Simply fold it in half or roll it up.</li>
    <li>If you prefer a softer dosa, you can flip it over and cook for a few seconds on the other side.</li>
    <li>Serve the dosa immediately with coconut chutney, sambar, or any other accompaniments of your choice.</li>
</ol>
