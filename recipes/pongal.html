    <li>Roast the Moong Dal:

        Dry roast the moong dal in a pan on low heat until it turns light golden and aromatic. This step is optional but enhances the flavor.</li>
    <li>Cook Rice and Dal:

        Wash the rice and roasted moong dal together.
        Add 4 cups of water and cook them in a pressure cooker for about 4-5 whistles. Alternatively, cook them in a pot until they become soft and mushy.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Tempering:

        Heat ghee in a pan.
        Add the cumin seeds, black peppercorns, and let them splutter.
        Add the chopped ginger, curry leaves, and a pinch of asafoetida. Saut√© for a minute.</li>
    <li>Add Cashews:

        Add the cashew nuts to the tempering and fry until they turn golden.</li>
    <li>Mix Everything:

        Once the pressure cooker releases, mash the cooked rice and dal mixture lightly.
        Add the tempering to this mixture.
        Add salt and mix well. If the pongal is too thick, you can add some hot water to adjust the consistency.</li>
    <li>Serve:

        Serve hot with coconut chutney or sambar.</li>
